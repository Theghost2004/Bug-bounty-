# Bug-bounty-30 days challenge
Today, I’m kicking off a 30-day challenge to sharpen my web pentesting and bug bounty hunting skills! 💻🔍 Every day, I’ll be learning, practicing, and sharing my progress—whether it’s mastering SQL Injection, XSS, LFI, SSRF, authentication bypasses, or automating recon. I’ll be solving PortSwigger labs, TryHackMe rooms, HackerOne challenges, and diving deep into real-world security vulnerabilities. 🛠️ My goal? To become proficient in web exploitation and eventually land my first bounty! I’ll be posting daily updates here to document my journey and keep myself accountable. 🚀 Follow along for insights, tips, and maybe even some bug bounty wins! Let’s hack and learn together! 💪🔒
